FunGEn (Functional Game Engine) is a BSD-licensed cross-platform 2D
game engine implemented in and for Haskell, using OpenGL and GLUT. It
was created in 2002 by Andre Furtado, updated in 2008 by Simon Michael
and Miloslav Raus, and revived again in 2011, with a GHC 6.12-tested
0.3 release on Hackage, preliminary haddockification and a new home
repo.

FunGEn remains the quickest path to building cross-platform graphical
games in Haskell, due to its convenient game framework and
widely-available dependencies. It comes with several working examples
that are quite easy to read and build (pong, worms). In the last six
months there has been little activity and a new maintainer would be
welcome. 

FunGEn-related discussions most often appear in the \#haskell-game
channel on irc.freenode.net.
